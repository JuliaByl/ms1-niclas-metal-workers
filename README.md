# Niclas Metal Workers

### Why am i making this?

Niclas Metal Workers is, while built for a fictional company in north Dublin, based on real requests from my dad, who has a very outdated website with code that doesn't work like it used to. 
In short: it's does not mirror his companys professionalism and needs an update. You can find a link to his current website [here. - URL](http://plat-niclas.com/).
Please not that permission has been given to share his website in the README.

#### User Stories

##### As an owner of the website, I want to...

1. Mirror my companys **proffesionalism** through smart color picks and a sleek but warm design
2. Show off my **versatility** through many images as well as informational text showing the different kinds of services I offer
3. Make sure customers know they can **contact the company with any ideas**, even if it's not mentioned as a service on the page, through multiple call to action buttons and a contact form
4. Target both newer and older generations through smart UX that **translates the needs of all ages**
