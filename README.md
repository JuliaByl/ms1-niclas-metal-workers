# Niclas Metal Workers

## Why am I making this?

Niclas Metalworkers is, while built for a fictional company in north Dublin, based on real preferences from my father, who currently has a company website he is not satisfied with.
In short: it doesn't mirror his company's professionalism and needs an update. You can find a link to his current website [here](http://plat-niclas.com/).
Please note that permission has been given to share his website in the README.

### User Stories

#### As an owner of the website, I want to...

1. Make it **clear** to the users what my website is about
2. Mirror my company's **proffesionalism** through smart color picks and a sleek but inviting design 
3. Show off my **versatility** through many images as well as informational text showing the different kinds of services I offer
4. Make sure customers know they can **contact the company with any ideas**, even if it's not mentioned as a service on the page, through multiple call to action buttons and a contact form
5. Target a wide audience, **through smart UX**

<hr>

#### As an external user, I want to...

1. Understand from the start what the company offers through a **good introduction** on main page
2. Feel like it's not a hassle to find information, through **easy and clear navigation**
3. Feel like I can **trust** the contractor through a good first impression
4. Find proof that the company can handle smaller **private customers as well as big companies and cooperate with other contractors**, through documentation of previous works and access to reviews.

### Features of the website
*This is the initial plan, if any changes occur to the design and layout, that will be put further down*

Across the entire page, everything is going to be styled using thirds, which is inspired by the Resume lesson from Code Insitiute.
Everything inside the header and body will be adhering to this as much as possible on big, medium and small screens. 
When not possible, they will be placed underneath each other instead.
This description is for a big screen layout. Please see wireframes for different screen size variations.
The short description of the layout is presented from top to bottom. 
Unless anything else is mentioned, it can be assumed that the content will be centered.
New row means it ends up under previous item. Any items described with a / between them is supposed to be placed next to each other.

### The bigest changes to my design

<hr>

#### Index.html

I decided to change the layout for index.html because it looks much better this way, and some if my initial text sesions could be put in different sections of the page instead.

<hr>

#### Services.html

Instead of doing a 3-grid on both large and medium screens sizes, I decided to have 2 images vertically on medium screen sizes.
